about: |
  A tool to edit text quickly. I created it to automate a task for my father's job, but I ended up developing it to be capable of a lot more.
  I made this before I knew Regex was a thing so I was reinventing the wheel and didn't even know it :d Even so, this little tool is still useful sometimes.
