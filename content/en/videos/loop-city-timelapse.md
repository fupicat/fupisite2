about: I took part in a game dev competition called Ludum Dare, where you have
  72 hours to make a game. I ended up using only 16 and thought it turned out to
  be a cool little game! The theme was "stuck in a loop", so I basically made a
  point and click adventure puzzle game where you endlessly fall through a hole
  that repeats itself, and in this hole there are people that you have to help
  in order to get out. Initially I had recorded the development to make a
  devlog/post mortem but I don't feel like recording audio so I just made a
  timelapse with the footage I had.
