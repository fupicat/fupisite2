about: |
  The first game in the ScratcherZ series. Inspired mainly by Pinguim10's game [Vidas](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/167908369/) on Scratch, I created a virtual world game based on Club Penguin. Before release it was supposed to be called Catest, and the characters would be cats, but then I changed my mind and made a simple character with few frames to be easy to create customization.

  This version of the game, the fourth and last update, is an Easter party. You had to find the hidden eggs in the rooms to earn creds as a reward.

  You can go to the extras menu to change the language of the game and see some old websites that I made for it.

  This project became very popular because it was curated (put on the front page of Scratch, the site where the game was shared), but many players had problems because of the half-assed implementation of the language choice.

  If you want to play the other versions and see an amazing multi-million dollar carnival parade, they are available in the [ScratcherZ studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1840308/).
