instructions:
  - Click to play a note.
  - Move the cursor up and down to change key.
  - Click the buttons to change instrument.
about:
  - This is an online multiplayer music-making toy! Call your friends and make music together!
  - Heavily inspired by the online game Plink! by Dinahmoe. I used no samples from the original game, I made them on Auxy and Beepbox.
  - This was the first multiplayer game I've ever made... or at least the first one where I actually knew what I was doing. :d
