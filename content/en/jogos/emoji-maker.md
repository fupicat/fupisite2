  Emoji Maker!! Yay!
  There's not a lot of variation of parts because this was made in the early days of emoji, back when the funniest emoji was the pile of poo and before the time when using emoji was considered *cringe*. So there weren't a lot of different emoji to choose from.
  Here are some emoji codes for you to try: 10110210 ; 04040415 ; 04130513 ; 08080217 ; 01100509 ; 01010515 ; 06020502
