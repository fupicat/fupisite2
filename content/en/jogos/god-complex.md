about:
  - This game was made for the Ludum Dare 45 game jam.
  - I got 550th place out of 2613 participants.
  - I think this is one of the most creative games I've made! Even though it's slow and unbalanced, it's relaxing and unique, and fits in with the jam's theme really well. Be prepared to wait though, as it's an idle game, you'll often need to wait quite a bit for the item you need. In the mean time, create more dirt planets to generate more worship points!
