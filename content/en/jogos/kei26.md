about: |
  Kei26 is an experimental game about an aspiring game dev.

  Explore their broken, abandoned projects, and learn more about who they are.

  Sometimes this is more of a walking simulator than an actual platforming game, but my intention with this game was to try and tell a story in an unconventional way.

  Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 49!
