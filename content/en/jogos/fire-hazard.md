instructions: >-
  * Drag your mouse from the guns to the outlets to plug them in.

  * Drag the plugs away from the outlet to unplug.

  * Each gun kills one type of enemy, and they shoot automatically.

  * If you have too much stuff plugged in, the fire meter will rise faster.

  * If you let the fire meter fill completely, or you let three enemies pass, you lose.

  You are the new intern at the Duhm√®s Corporation. Your job as a technician
  ended up being a bit more intense than expected, as the company building is
  constantly under attack, and you have nowhere near enough power! Can you learn
  to make do?
