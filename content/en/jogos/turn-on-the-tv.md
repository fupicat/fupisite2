about:
  - This game was created for Not A Game Jam, where we had to create games that are not games.
  - I created this bizarre game that has no objective and you can only play once.
  - This was the first jam I ever took part in! I was able to prove to myself that I could quickly and easily create silly little games if I wanted to, something that is surprisingly important to me.
