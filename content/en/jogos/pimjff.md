about: |
  I made this game because I really felt like making a platform game. Finished in 2 days.

  The name of the game is an acronym for "Platformer I Made Just For Fun".

  The mood and story of this game are very much inspired by the game Portal 2, even the songs are all from there! Except the last one, which I made myself.
