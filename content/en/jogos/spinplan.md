about: |
  The Eggo species has waged war against the planets! Luckily, the planets are benevolent, and decide to help the Eggos get what they want.

  Use gravity to get the Eggo combatant to your core! Rotate yourself!

  Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 48! It was my worst placed game. :d People didn't like the physics.
