  The game was made in 3 hours and can be very confusing..

  This game was created for the Trijam game jam, where I had 3 hours to make a game.

  The theme was 'no graphics', so I made a game that is sound only! Technically my only game that can be played by blind people, though to my knowledge no blind person has played it yet so I can't be sure. :d

  I got 3rd place out of 8 contestants.
