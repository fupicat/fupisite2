about:
  - My second site, made with Wix. I tried to do something fun on the home page, like a little town, but it's so buggy! I based this idea on the old "Turma da MÃ´nica" website that had a similar home page.
  - On this site, you will see hilariously vague and OP bios for characters I almost never use. You will also see several broken links..... many of the services I used on that site no longer work.
  - I also started adding a comic to site but never finished it. That comic exists on paper here at home, maybe someday I will post it.
  - I think this counts as my first "serious" attempt at web design. My first site was just a template with different text, but this time I had really tried to make something cool from scratch.
