Yesterday, I published a tool on my GitHub page that can automatically format text. It's called Replacer and it was originally made to make my father's job easier, so he could copy and paste several emails at once. But, by working on it further, I've made this little tool capable of much more.

You can use it to replace text fragments with others, insert characters in the middle of your text, replace specific positions of your text, and remove any unwanted parts automatically.

Give it a try: https://fupicat.github.io/replacer/en

Now I'll stop working on SZ and continue other projects, like finally finishing my website.
