Hello, I'm **Fupi**. I've been creating *stuff* on the internet since 2013, and this site is where I show them off. Here, you'll find all kinds of *stuff*, for example:

- Games
- Music
- Videos
- Unfinished projects
- Tutorials (coming soon?)
- Anything else I feel like posting

Most of my new games are made for game jams, specifically Ludum Dare.

If you want to know about new projects, works-in-progress, etc., [follow me on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/fupibr) Actually, my Twitter is Portuguese only, so you may have a hard time..

All my music, sounds and art are **public domain** (unless another license is specified). So are many of my games and code. Feel free to use my *stuff* as you wish, credit is optional.

## What I use

If you want to know the programs and other *stuff* I use, here's a little list of what I can remember:

### Open source

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (games and motion graphics)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/) (graphics and image editing)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (3D modeling, animation, motion graphics and video effects)
- [Tahoma2D](https://tahoma2d.org/) (frame-by-frame animation)
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (endlessly useful audio editor)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (has a very complete inspector, you can screenshot specific HTML elements, and open downloaded files without saving them)
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/download/) (<span title="super unstable and bad actually sry ;n;">video editor</span> that I use for simple videos with few transitions and effects)
- [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) (simple DAW for music composition)

### Free

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (code editor I used to make this website)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (vector graphics, like my logo)

### Paid

- [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) (fantastic DAW for composing and mixing music - has a very generous free trial)
- VEGAS Movie Studio 13 Platinum (my main video editor that, although old, is good and cheap - looks like it's no longer available for purchase)
