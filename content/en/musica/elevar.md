about:
  - This was originally made as a fan-song to the movie Presos no Elevador (R.I.P.), with Elias doing the vocals. If you want to hear that version of the song, check the links below.
  - A week later I decided to make the video above, which is also my first real project using Blender. Many thanks to the people at <a href="https://www.sheepit-renderfarm.com/">SheepIt</a> for rendering the frames for me while I was sleeping lel
