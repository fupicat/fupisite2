  I like this song a lot, it's very calm and the melody is nice. The clicks are a little loud but otherwise it is great.

  There are 3 versions of this song: [the beta](https://youtu.be/hsqhXErE9cE?t=1193) (same melody but was deleted because it was sounding weird), [the original](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/238093931/) and the revision (the version used in the video).

  The beta is the most different, the only difference between the original and the revised version is that the revised version has a brief silence in the middle of the song, right after the first time the "chorus" plays.

  The video is pretty lame, I made it because I hadn't posted the song on YouTube yet, and I had just made the revised version so why not make a video too?

  Fun fax: "Vaata" actually means "water" in a language I was creating around the time I released this. I'm not making that conlang anymore, but the name of the song stayed that way because I thought it sounded nice.
